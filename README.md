# Web Scraper and Topic Classification

## Overview
This project includes two main components:
1. **Web Scraper**: Scrapes article data from Medium or similar websites.
2. **Topic Classifier**: Uses machine learning (XGBoost) to classify articles based on their content.

---

## Steps to Run the Scraper

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the scraper**:
   Modify the `author_url` in the scraper script to scrape the desired website:
   ```python
   author_url = "https://medium.com/specific-author"
   ```

   Then execute the scraper:
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

4. **Check output**: Scraped data will be saved in `scraped_articles.csv`.

## Dependencies and Required Libraries

Ensure the following libraries are installed:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `pandas`
- `nltk`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas nltk scikit-learn xgboost
```

You might also need to download NLTK resources:
```bash
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## How to Retrain the Model or Adjust Topic Classification Rules

1. **Retraining the Model**:
   - Add or modify the `sample_data` in the training script to include more examples for training.
   - Execute the training script:
     ```bash
     python train_model.py
     ```
   - The model will automatically be retrained, and results will be printed.

2. **Adjusting Classification Rules**:
   - You can tune the machine learning model by modifying the hyperparameters in `param_grid` in the training script.
   - Use `GridSearchCV` to automatically find the best parameters for your data.

---

## Known Limitations

- The scraper is designed for Medium and similar websites; it may not work for all websites without modifications.
- The topic classifier is only as good as the training data. If your content diverges from the training examples, results may not be accurate.
- The model does not handle non-English languages.
- Websites with strict anti-bot measures might block scraping attempts, even with `headers` in place.
