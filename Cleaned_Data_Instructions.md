Instructions for Running the Scraper and Handling Different Websites:

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:
   ```
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
   

2. **Running the Scraper:**
   - Update the `author_url` with the starting URL of the website you want to scrape.
   - Run the script using:
     ```
     python scraper.py
     
   - The script will scrape the articles from the provided Medium author's page and save the data in a CSV file called `scraped_articles.csv`.

3. **Handling Different Websites:**
   - **HTML Structure:** Modify the parsing logic (`soup.find()`, `soup.find_all()`) to match the HTML structure of the target website.
   - **Pagination:** Update the logic for finding the "Next" page button/link if the website uses a different pagination system.
   - **Headers and Delays:** To prevent blocking, make sure you set appropriate headers and include random delays (`time.sleep`) between requests.

4. **Customizing for Other Websites:**
   - Analyze the target websiteâ€™s HTML structure using browser developer tools (right-click > Inspect) to adjust the selectors and extract the desired content (e.g., articles, titles, links).
