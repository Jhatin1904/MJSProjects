### Instructions for Reproducing Results with the Provided Machine Learning Model:

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

2. **Download NLTK Resources:**
   Download the necessary NLTK resources (stopwords and wordnet):
   ```bash
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

3. **Model Files and Training Data:**
   - **Training Data:** The script uses a sample dataset (`sample_data`) with topics like AI, Robotics, Technology, etc. If you have more extensive training data, you can replace the `sample_data` with your own DataFrame of text and topic columns.
   - **Model Files:** After training the model, it will classify new articles using the trained `XGBClassifier`. To save the trained model, you can use:
     ```python
     import joblib
     joblib.dump(best_model, 'best_xgb_model.pkl')
     ```
   - You can later load the model using:
     ```python
     best_model = joblib.load('best_xgb_model.pkl')
     ```

4. **Running the Code:**
   - Preprocess the data using the `preprocess_text()` function.
   - Train the XGBoost classifier using the TF-IDF vectorized features.
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best model.
   - Test the model on new data or scrape articles (from the previous scraper) and classify them.

5. **Classifying New Articles:**
   Ensure the new articles' DataFrame has a `clean_content` column with preprocessed text. The model will predict the topics for the new articles and save the results to `classified_articles.csv`.

6. **Reproducing the Results:**
   - To reproduce the results, run the entire script provided.
   - If you wish to classify new articles, ensure the scraper works correctly and adds a `clean_content` column to the articles DataFrame. Then, the classification part will run as shown above.
